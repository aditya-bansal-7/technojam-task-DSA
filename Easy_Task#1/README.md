Objective - a program to reverse an array .

Approch - I use a for loop which run half of array length . if i is the first index so last index will be arr.length - i - 1 . Then i create a temp varible for swaping . At last print the array  .

Note - It was Easy in python all we need to do use slice functionality like *arr[::-1]* . It will revese the array .

Result - It reverse the array in time complexity O(n).
