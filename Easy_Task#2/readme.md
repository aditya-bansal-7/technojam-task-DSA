Objective - Given an array of N integers, and an integer K, the task is to find the number of pairs of integers in the array whose sum is equal to K.

Approch - Fisrt i declare a int a which starting value is 0 , After that i used two for loop . First one 0 to arr.length and second one form i to arr.length . than i use if with condition of adding both integers is equal to K . if condition is true increse the value of a by one . Atlast return the value of a.

Result - Return the value in time complexity of O(n^2) .
