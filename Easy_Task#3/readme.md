Objective - Given an array arr[] of size N-1 with integers in the range of [1, N], the task is to find the missing number from the first N integers.

Approch - First i create a variable sum in which i store the sum upto to N . Using for loop from 0 to arr.length . I substract every array value from the sum and atlast i return the sum.

Result - Finded the missing number N in time complexity of O(n).
